# \# SASRec-Enriched – Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation with Enriched Features (PyTorch)

# 

# \*\*Author:\*\* Trong Ho – hdhtrong@gmail.com  

# 

# This repository implements \*\*self-attentive sequential recommendation models enriched with user ratings and item categories\*\* for improved recommendation accuracy, based on:

# > \*Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation Models Enriched with More Features\*  

# > \[ACM DL](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3695719.3695727)

# 

# It extends SASRec/TiSASRec by incorporating auxiliary information into input representations, improving sequential recommendation performance on public datasets (e.g., `ml-1m`).

# 

# \## Features

# 

# \- Self-attention based sequential recommendation  

# \- Enriched with \*\*user ratings\*\* \& \*\*item categories\*\*  

# \- PyTorch v1.6 implementation  

# \- Pretrained models included for inference  

# \- Code partially based on \[pmixer/TiSASRec.pytorch](https://github.com/pmixer/TiSASRec.pytorch/tree/master)
